            <h2>Rolex </h2>
            <p>
                Beloved by A-listers for decades, Rolex makes a serious style statement. The brand combines technical precision and durability with chic design. Available in a variety of metals and finishes – including Rolex’s patented Everose gold, which will never tarnish – as well as sizes, there’s a Rolex to suit any style. These timepieces have also been through some of the harshest conditions. Think the summit of Mt Everest and the depths of the ocean; they are built to last. A Rolex is always the right choice; you can wear it to brunch, a black-tie event, or on the ski slopes.

                <h2>Chanel</h2>
                <p>When it comes to luxury watches, you cannot go past Chanel. Some of the brand’s most iconic motifs – including bouclé tweed fabric, camellia flowers, and the black and white color palette – carry through in all watch ranges. While the classic Chanel look is very feminine, the brand also produces more minimalist and androgynous designs. However, you can be sure its beloved designers, Madame Coco herself and Karl Lagerfeld, would approve of them all!</p>
